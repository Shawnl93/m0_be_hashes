# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? I really struggled on the login status
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? Not taking is going great, it's the only reason im able to figure out my problem. Writing down MULTIPLE EXAMPLES
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I really try to solve a problem on my own.. sometimes a little too long and then I lean into googling
